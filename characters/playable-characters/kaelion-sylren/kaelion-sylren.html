It was said that those born under extraordinary celestial events were destined for something great- something extraordinary. This meant that Kaelion's destiny was intertwined with the stars themselves, as if Kaelion was written into the very fabric of the cosmos. From a young age they have felt this connection deep in their bones, as though the heavens themselves were speaking directly to Kaelion.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Growing up in the heart of the <strong>High Forest</strong>, a vast and untouched wilderness, Kaelion was drawn to the mysteries of the night sky. As a child, they would often wander from the safety of their family's home, slipping into the cool night air to gaze up at the stars. With every nightfall, they felt the pull of the sky-its patterns, its hidden meanings. Kaelion would trace constellations, carefully sketching the observations into an old, worn journal, convinced that each star held a secret to be discovered. These quiet, solitary moments under the vast canopy of stars were Kaelion's greatest joy, and it was during these nights that they first met <strong><a data-href="Eluna Stormwhisper" href="characters/npc's/eluna-stormwhisper.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Eluna Stormwhisper</a></strong>, a fellow Skywatcher apprentice.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Eluna - The Guiding Light" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Eluna_-_The_Guiding_Light"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Eluna - The Guiding Light</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Eluna was everything that Kaelion wasn't. Where Kaelion was intuitive, feeling their way through the mysteries of the world, Eluna was meticulous, driven by a thirst for knowledge and a determination to understand the hidden truths of the stars. Unlike the rest of the tribe, who seemed to grasp the celestial arts with natural ease, Eluna had to work tirelessly to connect with the heavens. Yet it was this very dedication that Kaelion admired-Eluna's drive was infectious, and the two quickly became inseparable. They spent their days together, training in the druidic arts, learning how to speak to the land and commune with the natural world. Their nights were spent mapping the heavens, tracing the paths of the stars, searching for meaning in the ever-changing sky.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The bond between Kaelion and Eluna grew stronger with each passing season. The two were more than companions; they were partners, friends, and, perhaps unknowingly, two souls bound by the very stars they studied. They often spoke about destiny and adventure, dreaming of the day they would leave the High Forest behind, exploring the world beyond the trees. Eluna, more than anyone, understood Kaelion's deep connection to the celestial world and was always there to challenge their assumptions, push them to learn more, to see beyond the obvious.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Eluna was Kaelion's light in the darkness- the one person who knew Kaelion inside and out, who shared their passion for the stars and their dreams of a world full of discovery. Together they were unstoppable, a force that seemed destined for greatness.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But as the seasons passed, something ominous began to stir in the heavens. The stars seemed to shift, becoming restless, as if preparing to reveal something the world was not ready to know.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="The Night of the Omen" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Night_of_the_Omen"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Night of the Omen</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">One evening, as Kaelion and Eluna gazed up at the sky, a sudden flash of light caught their attention. An unfamiliar constellation flickered into existence, its patterns unlike any Kaelion had seen before. At first, it was faint, a brief flash of light among the familiar stars. But then it pulsed, a steady, rhythmic glow that seemed to pulse with an unspoken energy. Kaelion's heart skipped a beat, there was something deeply wrong with the stars that night, something they couldn't explain, yet it gnawed at Kaelion's very soul.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Kaelion turned to Eluna, seeking answers, but the look in their companion's eyes mirrored the same unease Kaelion felt. Eluna was already searching for her quarterstaff, her eyes scanning the trees. She could sense it too. The sense of foreboding was <strong>palpable</strong>, hanging in the air like a heavy fog.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Before Kaelion could speak, they felt it- a sudden and overwhelming <strong>sense of loss</strong>, as though the very stars were trying to communicate something urgent. They looked around to find Eluna, calling out her name, but Eluna was gone, their usual spot, beneath the ancient oak tree where they had spent countless nights together, was empty. There were no signs, no clues- only an eerie silence. The stars overhead flickered and dimmed, as if to mark her absence.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Frantic, Kaelion searched the forest for days, rallying others from the tribe to help. They combed the wilderness, scouring every familiar trail. every nook and cranny where Eluna could have gone. Yet, despite their efforts, there was no sign of Eluna. Days turned to weeks, and still, no trace of her could be found. The tribe began to whisper, their voices filled with suspicion and dread. Some believed Eluna had been taken by <strong>dark forces</strong>, others thought she had simply wandered too far and perished. But Kaelion knew the truth deep in their heart: the stars had tried to warn them, but they had failed to understand.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The very omen that had signaled Eluna's disappearance was a mystery in itself, a cosmic puzzle that Kaelion could not solve. But they were sure of one thing: the stars had not just guided Eluna away- they had chosen her for something, something Kaelion was not meant to know.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="The Withdrawal" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Withdrawal"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Withdrawal</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Kaelion was consumed by guilt and sorrow. They could not bear the thought of continuing their life among the tribe while Eluna's fate remained uncertain. For years, Kaelion isolated themselves from the tribe, retreating into the deep wilds of the High Forest. There, they found solace only in the company of the land and the sky- the whispering winds and the distant stars seemed to call out to them, ever so faintly. They spent their days meditating, their nights tracing constellations in the hopes that one day, they would find the answer to what happened to Eluna.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Time passed, but Kaelion's heart remained broken. Memories of Eluna haunted their every step, and every night beneath the stars felt like a reminder of what had been lost. Yet Kaelion couldn't stop searching, even as the world outside the forest moved on.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="The Return of the Omen" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Return_of_the_Omen"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Return of the Omen</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, years later, Kaelion's heart has stirred once again. The strange constellation that had flickered into existence the night Eluna vanished has reappeared, brighter and more intense than ever before. Its light pulses with an unspoken message, one Kaelion feels deep within their bones- this is no coincidence. The time has come. The stars are calling again, but this time, Kaelion knows they cannot ignore their summons.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The mourning is over, and the stars have not forgotten them. With their quarterstaff in hand, a new resolve has taken root within Kaelion. They must seek the truth, no matter the cost. The search for Eluna is no longer just a matter of grief- it is a quest for understanding, for redemption, and for the cosmic answers that have eluded them for so long.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">With the wisdom of the heavens as their guide, Kaelion steps beyond the forest's borders, ready to follow the stars wherever they may lead. Whether the path leads to redemption or ruin, Kaelion will no longer hide from the truth. The stars have spoken, and Kaelion will answer.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Wandering Starts" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Wandering_Starts"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Wandering Starts</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I was 92 when I left the High Forest. I remember the silence that followed me, a shadow that refused to let go. For the first time in my life, the stars above felt distant—cold pinpricks of light against an unforgiving sky. I wandered aimlessly, following no path but the one my feet carved through the earth. Days bled into nights, weeks into months. Half a year of solitude, drifting from one place to another, a nameless ghost with no destination.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Then I stumbled into <strong>Citadel Fellbar</strong>, weary and hungry, longing for a momentary escape from my thoughts. The tavern was loud, chaotic—a cacophony of laughter and drunken shouts. I found a corner to hide in, hoping to disappear among the noise. That’s when <strong>I heard his voice</strong>. Warm, inviting, reckless. <strong><a data-href="Sariel" href="characters/playable-characters/sariel/sariel.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sariel</a>.</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I didn’t mean to laugh at his jokes, but I did. I didn’t mean to drink so much, but the mugs kept coming. By the end of the night, I was tangled in his embrace, his breath warm against my neck, his laughter echoing in my ears. It was the first time in months that I felt alive. But come morning, fear settled in—fear of connection, of attachment, of losing someone again. <strong>So I left</strong>. I slipped out before dawn, leaving nothing but a cold, empty bed behind.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Part of me hoped I’d never see him again. It would be easier that way. But the stars are cruel—they weave fates we cannot escape.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I wandered once more, retreating into the wilds, avoiding cities whenever I could. For nearly <strong>four years</strong>, I lived as a hermit, surrounded by trees and shadows, speaking only to the wind. Loneliness became a companion, a familiar ache I could not cure. Yet even then, I could not forget the way Sariel laughed, the warmth of his smile.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Fate, it seems, was not finished with me.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I found myself near <strong>Luskan</strong>, a bustling harbor city brimming with life and noise. I only meant to stop for a meal, a brief respite from the road. The tavern was crowded, the air thick with salt and laughter. I ate quietly, head down, until I heard a voice—familiar, teasing, unforgettable.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Look who it is, the elf that snuck away from me. <strong>Kaelion, was it?</strong>”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I turned, and there he was. <strong>Sariel</strong>, grinning like he’d won the world. I didn’t know what to say. But he laughed, clapped me on the back, and ordered two mugs of ale before I could protest. We talked for hours, slipping easily into conversation, as if no time had passed at all.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We agreed to travel together—just for a few days, we said. But days became weeks, weeks became months, and before I knew it, <strong>years</strong> had passed. We wandered the <strong>Sword Coast</strong>, getting into trouble, sharing stories beneath star-filled skies. Somewhere along the way, he became my family—the brother I never had.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A <strong>decade</strong> slipped by unnoticed. I no longer remembered what it felt like to be alone. We became inseparable, two souls tied by fate and laughter, drawn together by the whims of the stars.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Over a century</strong> has passed since that day in Luskan. <strong>Sariel</strong> is still by my side, a constant in this ever-changing world. Together, we solve mysteries, chase shadows, laugh in the face of danger. I no longer run from my past—I face it, with him beside me.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The stars may be distant, but they have led me to where I need to be. And as long as Sariel is with me, I know I’m not alone.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="**Forsaken Gifts**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Forsaken_Gifts**"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><strong>Forsaken Gifts</strong></h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Before I left the High Forest, the magic of the wilds flowed through me as naturally as breath. I could call upon the winds, mend wounds with a whisper, and shift my form to run with the beasts of the land. The stars, ever watchful, guided my path—whispering truths in the quiet of the night.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But the night I lost <strong>Eluna</strong>, I lost my faith as well. The heavens had shown me an omen, a sign I failed to understand. If the stars truly held our fates, then why had they stolen the one person I could not bear to lose?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">So I turned my back on them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When I vanished into the wilds, I left more than my tribe behind—I left my <strong>magic</strong>. At first, it was out of defiance. Then, it became habit. The power I once wielded dulled, like an unused blade left to rust. <strong>A decade passed</strong>, and the wilds became my home, but the magic no longer felt like it was mine. <strong>Not using it became my new normal.</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When I finally returned to the world, I did so as an echo of what I had been. <strong>Sariel never questioned it.</strong> He knew I could handle myself, but he never saw the magic I once held. He never knew that I had once called upon the sky to answer my will. And I never told him.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Even now, I hesitate. The stars have begun to shift again, their whispers creeping back into my thoughts. My magic stirs like an ember buried beneath cold ash. But do I dare rekindle it?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h1 heading-wrapper"><h1 data-heading="Character Quirks" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Character_Quirks">Character Quirks</h1><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-ol"><ol>

<li data-line="5" dir="auto"><strong>Odd Sleeping Habits</strong> - Kaelion <strong>sleeps outside whenever possible</strong>, even if there's a perfectly good inn, they'd rather be under the stars. Indoors, they position themselves by a windows, restless if they can't see the night sky.</li>
<li data-line="6" dir="auto"><strong>Celestial Cooking</strong> - They like to <strong>align their meals with the phases of the moon</strong> (e.g. only eating certain herbs or brewing specific teas during certain lunar cycles.)

<li data-line="7" dir="auto"><strong>Unshakably Calm...

This tribe believed that the heavens wove the tapestry of fate, and those who could read the stars, could catch glimpses of the future. According to the tribe Kaelion's destiny was intertwined with the stars themselves, as if Kaelion was written into the very fabric of the cosmos. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Growing up in the heart of the <strong>High Forest</strong>, a vast and untouched wilderness, Kaelion was drawn to the mysteries of the night sky. As a child, they would often wander from the safety of their family's home, slipping into the cool night air to gaze upon the stars. With every nightfall Kaelion felt the pull of the sky, it's patterns and it's hidden meanings. Kaelion would trace constellations, carefully stretching the observation into an old, worn journal, convinced that each star held a secret to be discovered. These quiet, solitary moments under the vast canopy of stars were Kaelion's greatest joy.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As Kaelion grew older and the seasons passed, something ominous began to stir in the heavens. The stars seemed to shift, becoming restless, as if preparing to reveal something the world was not ready to know.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But one night, the stars changed. A new constellation appeared, one they had never seen before, shimmering with an eerie brilliance that <strong>stirred something deep within them</strong>. Though they did not understand its meaning, they could not shake the feeling that it was important. And then, without warning, Kaelion left.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">They withdrew into the untamed wilds, vanishing from their people without explanation. Years passed in solitude, with only the whispering wind and the silent sky for company. In the quiet of the deep forest, they sought understanding, watching, waiting, searching the heavens for a sign.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, after all this time, the stars have shifted once more. The same strange constellation that once unsettled them has returned, brighter and more insistent than before. Kaelion knows this is no mere coincidence. Whatever it is, <strong>it is calling them back to the world</strong>.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Taking up their quarterstaff and the wisdom earned through years of silence, Kaelion steps forward once more, guided by the stars. The path ahead is uncertain, but they will follow wherever the heavens lead, no matter what awaits them at the journey’s end.</p></div><div class="mod-footer mod-ui"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sidebar-right sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content"><div class="graph-view-wrapper"><div class="sidebar-section-header">Interactive Graph</div><div class="graph-view-placeholder">
